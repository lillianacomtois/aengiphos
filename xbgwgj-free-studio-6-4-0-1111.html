Hi, As a way to thank this sub and mod creatores i decided to create a modlist for my shitty pc and post it on reddit! About this modlist i tried to mod as much as i could around stable fps, lot's of immersion and lore friendly mods. I started my new playthrough and, as far as i've tested, this is stable, soo i didn't found a CTD yet. For obvious reasons this was made and tested for oldrim. I avoided new land mods and just add few armor mods just because i have them - that ISN'T the focus. –ù–∞ –Ω–∞—à–µ–º —Å–∞–π—Ç–µ –í—ã –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç–µ —É–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å –≤–µ—Å—å —Ä–µ–µ—Å—Ç—Ä —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ü–û. –ê–∫—Ç—É–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å —Ä–µ–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞ ‚Äì 5 —Å–µ–Ω—Ç—è–±—Ä—è Encounter relaxation at SpringHill Suites St. Louis Brentwood.
